# ``LeetCode``

A personal library of algorithm solutions implemented in Swift 6.

## Overview

This library serves as a reference for various LeetCode problems, focusing on professional Swift implementation and clear documentation. Each solution is developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow with the **Swift Testing** framework.

## Organisation

To ensure the documentation is sorted chronologically while keeping source files easy to navigate, the following conventions are used:

- **Namespaces (Enums)**: Prefixed with a four-digit zero-padded number (e.g., `P0017`) for correct sorting in the DocC browser.
- **Source Files**: Named using the standard problem number and title (e.g., `17.LetterCombinations.swift`) for natural sorting in the file system.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is split to provide information where it is most relevant:

- **Implementation**: Contains the problem link, difficulty, topics, high-level description, preconditions, and complexity analysis.
- **Test Suite**: Contains specific example data (Inputs/Outputs) for individual test cases.
