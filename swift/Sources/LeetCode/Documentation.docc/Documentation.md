# ``LeetCode``

A library of algorithm solutions in Swift, sourced from LeetCode problems.

## Overview

Each solution lives in a numbered enum (`P0001`, `P0002`, …) that namespaces its functions.
Problems include full metadata — difficulty, topics, constraints, and a link back to
LeetCode — right in the DocString, so everything is browsable in Xcode Quick Help.

Built with Swift Testing and a TDD workflow: tests first, implementation second.
